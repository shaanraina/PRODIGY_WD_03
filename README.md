Explanation

HTML: The structure remains mostly the same, but we set up everything with more CSS classes for better control over styling.

CSS:

Enhanced styling for the board and cells, with hover effects and transitions for interactivity.
Improved button styles with hover and active states.
Added styles for win and draw states for better visual feedback.

JavaScript:

Added highlightWinningCells to visually highlight winning cells.
Updated checkResult to update the message dynamically and handle the draw scenario.
The resetGame function now also removes any added classes for win or draw states and resets the message.
Initial message setup for indicating whose turn it is.

This implementation results in a more visually appealing and user-friendly Tic-Tac-Toe game with better feedback and smoother interactions.
